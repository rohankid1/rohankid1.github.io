Before starting AGS, you first need to make sure pywal has been ran at least
once, so it can generate a file in `ags/style/colors.scss`, which is a
symbolic link that points to `~/.cache/wal/colors.scss`. If you don't,
it may not load fully, or the UI may not have any styling. To do this,
you can run:
```sh
wal -i /path/to/image_you_want
```
