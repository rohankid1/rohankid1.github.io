<Steps>
1. **Install dependencies**

    For a full setup / same setup as mine, you will need to install several dependencies.
    I use CachyOS which is an Arch-based distro, so I use pacman/paru to install from the Arch repositories/AUR.
    Most software here should be in your distro's repositories. If not, check the
    website of the dependency. Otherwise, you can cherry-pick which stuff you want to
    include in your setup.

    ```sh
    sudo pacman -S git stow libnotify python-pywal starship kitty hyprland fuzzel fish hyprlock hypridle otf-hermit-nerd ttf-ubuntu-font-family
    ```

    <Aside title="Important">
        Some packages are not available in the official Arch repos, but they are in the AUR. Use an AUR helper such as yay or paru:

        <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="Paru">
            ```sh
            paru -S pyprland hyprpolkitagent-git grimshot-bin-sway aylurs-gtk-shell
            ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Yay">
            ```sh
            yay -S pyprland hyprpolkitagent-git grimshot-bin-sway aylurs-gtk-shell
            ```
        </TabItem>
        </Tabs>
    </Aside>

2. **Clone the repository**

    First, git clone the repository by running the following command:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/rohankid1/cachy-dotfiles/ 
    ```

3. **Rename and move the directory**

    ```sh
    mv ~/path/to/cachy-dotfiles $HOME/.dotfiles
    ```

4. **Cd into the directory and stow it**

    <Aside type="caution">
        `stow *` will "stow" everything in it.
        To "stow" a specific one, do `stow <DIR>` instead.
        For example, `stow hypr`
    </Aside>

    ```sh
    cd ~/.dotfiles && stow *
    ```
</Steps>

After you complete these steps, you can log into Hyprland!
