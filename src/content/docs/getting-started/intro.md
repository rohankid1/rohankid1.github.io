Rosktop is a collection of dotfiles created by me for anyone to use freely.
By free, I mean free as in freedom. No unnecessary restrictions or whatever.

This is in work in progress and probably will always be, since I tend to add new
stuff that I like to have on my personal desktop.

## Software Used
I am forever ecstatic that these software exist, otherwise Rosktop wouldn't be a
thing:
* [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org) - Dynamic tiling compositor for Wayland that has the eyecandy and all the epic stuff
* [Ags](https://aylur.github.io/ags-docs/) - Widgets for any Wayland compositor that has gtk-layer-shell
* [Pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) - Colour scheme generator based on the wallpaper
* [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) - Terminal
* [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) - A really cool interactive shell
* [Fuzzel](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/fuzzel) - Application launcher that I instead use as an emoji picker (for now, probably)
* [Starship](https://starship.rs) - An amazing shell prompt written in Rust
* [Swww](https://github.com/LGFae/swww) - An amazing wallpaper daemon for Wayland that has beautiful transition options
